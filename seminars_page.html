				I took a leadership role in coordinating and managing the research project, 
				and as leader I set a clear vision for the thesis project, outlining the goals, 
				objectives, and expected outcomes. I organized regular meetings to keep 
				the team updated on the project's progress, discuss challenges, and 
				brainstorm solutions collaboratively. And as member of the team, 
				I contributed as additional manpower by creating a schematic design, 
				soldering and assembling the device.

            <p>
				Originally our thesis title was Solar Powered Automated Dichromatic Nyctolight and it enhances night safety with solar-powered lights, speed monitoring, emergency buttons, and selective illumination to save energy. It alerts on speeding, aids in emergencies, and conserves power by lighting only when necessary.
				Designed for safer outdoor nights, it uses solar energy for visibility without extra power needs. The speed monitor warns of risky driving, while the emergency button connects swiftly for help. This adaptable system aims for cost-effectiveness and improved safety. Yet some things are changed after our proposal thanks to the panelist and our adviser we came up with new ideas after the adjustment instructed by the panelist, thankfully panelist approved and it became our final thesis.

				The project's conclusion highlights the successful construction of the device, incorporating PIR and LDR sensors from the Solar Street Light 400W. The issue concerning the signal was resolved by extending the GSM antenna, improving the effectiveness of the SMS and alarm system. The positive evaluation, utilizing tests such as the ISO 25010 Functional Suitability Test and Usability Test, demonstrated that the Solar Powered Adaptive Dichromatic Street Lighting System's functionality was complete, accurate, and appropriate, leading to high acceptance. Furthermore, stability test results indicated that the system is reliable and user-friendly. In summary, the project's impact and results showcase the successful development and evaluation of an innovative street lighting system that is reliable, effective, and well-received by users.
